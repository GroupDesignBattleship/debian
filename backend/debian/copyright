 VERSION HISTORY:

 .
 I cleaned it up quite a bit to match the (linux kernel) style of the rest
 of libwebsockets; this version is under LGPL2.1 + SLE like the rest of lws
 since he explicitly allows sublicensing, but I give the URL above so you can
 get the original with Bob's super-liberal terms directly if you prefer.

 Thanks to Rodney Brown <rbrown64@csc.com.au> for his contribution of faster
 CRC methods: exclusive-oring 32 bits of data at a time, and pre-computing
 tables for updating the shift register in one step with three exclusive-ors
 instead of four steps with four exclusive-ors.  This results in about a
 factor of two increase in speed on a Power PC G4 (PPC7455) using gcc -O3.

 Structure for decoding tables.  Each entry provides either the
 information needed to do the operation requested by the code that
 indexed that table entry, or it provides a pointer to another
 table that indexes more bits of the code.  op indicates whether
 the entry is a pointer to another table, a literal, a length or
 distance, an end-of-block, or an invalid code.  For a table
 pointer, the low four bits of op is the number of index bits of
 that table.  For a length or distance, the low four bits of op
 is the number of extra bits to get after the code.  bits is
 the number of bits in this code or part of the code to drop off
 of the bit buffer.  val is the actual byte to output in the case
 of a literal, the base length or distance, or the offset from
 the current table to the next table.  Each entry is four bytes.

 Change history:
 .
 1.2.beta0    24 Nov 2002
 - First version -- complete rewrite of inflate to simplify code, avoid
 creation of window when not needed, minimize use of window when it is
 needed, make inffast.c even faster, implement gzip decoding, and to
 improve code readability and style over the previous zlib inflate code
 .
 1.2.beta1    25 Nov 2002
 - Use pointers for available input and output checking in inffast.c
 - Remove input and output counters in inffast.c

 This makefile is fully intergrated with this Android Studio project and
 it will be called automaticaly when you build the project with Gradle.
 .
 The source packages for the libraries will be automaticaly downloaded.
 Alternativly you can provide your own sources by placing the following
 files in the 'jni' directory:
 .
 zlib-1.2.8.tar.gz
 openssl-1.0.2g.tar.gz
 libwebsockets.tar.gz
 .
 This makefile was tested with the latest NDK/SDK and Android Studio at the
 time of this writing. As these software packages evolve changes to this
 makefile may be needed or it may become obselete...
 .
 This makefile was made for use in Linux but you may be able to edit it
 and make it work under Windows.
 .
 At least on Debian, building openssl requires package xutils-dev
 for makedepend. Ofcourse the standard development packages must also be
 installed, but xutils-dev is not that obvious in this case...
 .
 Makedepend will most likely print a lot of warnings during the 'make depend'
 stage of building openssl. In this case these warnings can be safely ignored.
 .
 Include Application.mk but do not complain if it is not found

 ALGORITHM
 .
 The "deflation" process depends on being able to identify portions
 of the input text which are identical to earlier input (within a
 sliding window trailing behind the input currently being processed).
 .
 The most straightforward technique turns out to be the fastest for
 most input files: try all possible matches and select the longest.
 The key feature of this algorithm is that insertions into the string
 dictionary are very simple and thus fast, and deletions are avoided
 completely. Insertions are performed at each input character, whereas
 string matches are performed only when the previous match ends. So it
 is preferable to spend more time in matches to allow very fast string
 insertions and avoid deletions. The matching algorithm for small
 strings is inspired from that of Rabin & Karp. A brute force approach
 is used to find longer strings when a small match has been found.
 A similar algorithm is used in comic (by Jan-Mark Wams) and freeze
 (by Leonid Broukhis).
 A previous version of this file used a more sophisticated algorithm
 (by Fiala and Greene) which is guaranteed to run in linear amortized
 time, but has a larger average cost, uses more memory and is patented.
 However the F&G algorithm may be faster for some highly redundant
